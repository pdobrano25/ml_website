This site is a portfolio of projects related to tabular machine learning.

The objective is to provide examples of workflows that enable predicting *something useful* from high dimensional data. 

**Projects**: machine learning workflows (in R) are provided based on existing publications by other research groups. In most cases, analyses are validated and extended.

[**Models**](https://pdobrano25.github.io/ml_website/ml_figures.html): common machine learning algorithms are listed, illustrated, and described.

[**About**](https://pdobrano25.github.io/ml_website/about.html): source code for analyses and a list of publications by Peter Dobranowski.
