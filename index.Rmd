This site is a portfolio of projects related to tabular machine learning.

The objective is to provide examples of workflows that enable predicting *something useful* from high dimensional data. 

**Models**: common machine learning algorithms are listed, illustrated, and described.

**Projects**: machine learning workflows (in R) are provided based on existing publications by other research groups. In most cases, analyses are validated and extended.

**About**: source code for analyses, and a list of publications by Peter Dobranowski.
