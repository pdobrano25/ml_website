## PDobrano's Machine Learning Projects


This site is a portfolio of projects related to tabular machine learning.

The objective is to provide examples of workflows that enable predicting *something useful* from high dimensional data. 

**Projects**: machine learning workflows (in R) are provided based on existing publications by other research groups. In most cases, analyses are validated and extended.

 - [Microbial Load Predictor](https://pdobrano25.github.io/ml_website/mlp_validation.html): A novel tool that predicts the number of bacterial cells in a metagenomic sample. A regression problem with internal and external validation. Other models are evaluated.
 - [Predicting Crohn's Disease (Microbiome)](https://pdobrano25.github.io/ml_website/gevers_validation.html): Validating a study from 2014 using (low biomass) microbiome samples obtained from biopsies in new-onset Crohn's disease. Results could not be validated without a discernible reason. Only internal validation was employed. Additional models are evaluated.
 - [Predicting IBD (Microbiome)](https://pdobrano25.github.io/ml_website/cmd_validation.html): Validating a meta-analysis from 2023 using stool microbiome samples obtained from 3 cohorts in the curatedMetagenomicData. 3 other cohorts were not available to download, so results could not be fully validated. Hybrid up/down sampling is applied. Additional models are evaluated.

[**Models**](https://pdobrano25.github.io/ml_website/ml_figures.html): common machine learning algorithms are listed, illustrated, and described.

[**About**](https://pdobrano25.github.io/ml_website/about.html): source code for analyses and a list of publications by Peter Dobranowski.
